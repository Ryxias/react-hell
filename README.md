# chuuni.me
A website where some friends who have no idea how to code build a website together, and maybe
learn a thing or two about ReactJS along the way.

## Mission Objective
Fun, curiosity, and just because. Features shall be built for the sake of learning and entertainment, and shall never 
be built for the sake of profit.

## Some Features

### School Idol Festival
We wrote a dumb thing that rolls random cards.

### World Clock
There's some thing that allows you to figure out what time it is yay.

### Slack Connection
We have some interesting slack integrations, I guess!


### Other Libraries
Along the way, several components were made into first class externa libraries for other people to use if they care.

* [service-container](https://github.com/Ryxias/service-container) — A Javascript-based dependency injection container,
inspirted by Symfony 3.0
* [express-route-registry](https://github.com/Ryxias/express-route-registry) — A suite of tools to make it easier to 
add and understand many routes in ExpressJS. Inspired by the [RAML](https://raml.org/) API modelling language.
